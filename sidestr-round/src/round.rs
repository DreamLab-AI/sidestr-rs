//! Level 2's round (`proposals/level-2.md`; `siding/lib/round.mjs`), as a
//! pure state machine.
//!
//! In Melvin Carvalho's words, adapted: the proposer for a height builds
//! the block and publishes it as a kind 23510 event; each other signer
//! checks it against its own chain and mempool and answers with a kind
//! 23511 partial signature; with `k` the proposer seals the block, adds it,
//! publishes it as a kind 23514 event for the others and announces it.
//! Signer keys are Nostr keys, so an event's author is the signer. One
//! signature per height per signer — unless that proposal has had
//! `proposeAfter` seconds to seal and has not: then a later, entitled
//! proposer may have mine too, or a stalled height (its proposer gone after
//! collecting fewer than `k`) would never move. And a proposer drops its
//! own proposal after `proposeAfter × n` seconds.
//!
//! # No I/O, no clock
//!
//! [`Round::tick`] and [`Round::on_event`] take the time as an argument
//! (unix **milliseconds**, as `Date.now()` is) and return a list of [`Action`]s — events to publish,
//! blocks that entered the chain, lines to log — for the caller to act on.
//! The chain is a port ([`ChainView`]): the in-memory state in a test, the
//! file-backed chain in a signer. Nothing here opens a socket or reads a
//! clock, so every branch of the protocol is testable with a fixed `now`.
//!
//! # Timing, to the millisecond
//!
//! `round.mjs` measures in `Date.now()` milliseconds and the same
//! comparisons hold here, with `propose_after` = `P` seconds and `n`
//! signers:
//!
//! | rule | reference | here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | one signature per height relaxes (`mayReSign`) | `now − signed.at > P·1000` | strictly more than `P` s after the signature's intent: at 30 001 ms for `P = 30`, not at 30 000 |
//! | my proposal is dropped | `now − pending.at > P·1000·n` | at 90 001 ms for `P = 30, n = 3` |
//! | a replayed proposal is ignored | `now/1000 − created_at > P·n` | `now − created_at·1000 > P·n·1000`: the same instant, 90 001 ms after the event's second |
//! | lateness (`entitled`) | `⌊(at − base) / 1000 / P⌋` | `(at − base) / (P·1000)`, integer; `base` = when the block became due, else the event's `created_at·1000` |
//! | the "signed … s ago" log | `Math.round(ms / 1000)` | rounded, the same |
//!
//! Events carry `created_at` in whole seconds (`now / 1000`), as NIP-01
//! requires; nothing on the wire changes.
//!
//! # Hardening, all behind options with upstream's behaviour as default
//!
//! - **The vote journal** ([`VoteJournal`]): the intent is journalled,
//!   durably, before the custody signer is asked, and the signature after
//!   it answers, before the `Publish` action is returned; a failed intent
//!   write means the signer is not called, a failed signature write means
//!   nothing is published. On restart the journal is loaded and the
//!   one-signature rule is applied against every entry.
//! - **`resign_after`** ([`RoundConfig::resign_after`]): upstream's
//!   relaxation (`Some(propose_after)`) by default, for interop; `None`
//!   never re-signs a height (ADR-2101). With `None`, a height whose
//!   proposal stranded stays stranded until the proposer returns — that is
//!   the trade the record chose, and it is the operator's to make.
//! - **A sealed block is a candidate**, ingested through the validator
//!   ([`ChainView::add_block`]) and never treated as final (review §9):
//!   nothing here decides finality, and a caller must not either.
//! - **Deterministic rules first, mempool policy second**: a proposal is
//!   judged under the chain's own rules (`StateOf::judge`, minus the two
//!   that cannot hold for an unsealed template: the block signature and the
//!   proof of work that sealing grinds) before any transaction reaches the
//!   mempool. Refusals are logged as `round.mjs` logs them; the one new
//!   refusal names the rules.
//!
//! # Honest limits
//!
//! This is upstream's protocol: it tolerates `n − k` signers being *down*
//! and nothing being *wrong*. A faulty proposer can strand a height; a
//! relay can delay a proposal past its window; two subsets of `k` can seal
//! one template to two hashes (`sidestr-core`'s template-versus-sealed
//! note). Byzantine tolerance is a separate protocol above the signature
//! (ADR-2101), not a setting here.
