//! The one error type every fallible function in this crate returns.
//!
//! siding throws `Error` objects whose *messages* are the contract its tests
//! match against (`/already claimed/`, `/below the minimum/`, `/not a hex
//! script/`). The messages here keep that wording where a test in `tests/`
//! depends on it, so a port of a siding test reads the same way.
