//! The parent chain as a producer or a signer sees it (SPEC 6, 7, 11; the
//! level-2 view): peg-ins found in the parent's blocks, whether one is still
//! unspent and how deep, the peg wallet's payment of a burn, the producer's
//! checkpoint, and the reconciliation of burns against what the wallet has
//! already paid. A port of `siding/lib/parent.mjs` and
//! `siding/lib/checkpoint.mjs` (Melvin Carvalho, AGPL-3.0).
//!
//! The node is behind two traits — [`ParentRpc`] for the chain (read-only)
//! and [`PegWallet`] for the peg wallet's own RPCs — and everything that
//! decides is a pure function of what they return: [`find_pegin`] over a
//! decoded transaction and the peg holders' ownership of its outputs, [`claimable`] over found peg-ins and the chain's
//! records, [`pegout_payment`] and [`checkpoint_payment`] as the outputs a
//! `send` call takes, [`reconcile`] over the chain's burns and the wallet's
//! history. One blocking JSON-RPC implementation, Bitcoin Core's, is behind
//! the `rpc` feature (`parent::rpc::CoreRpc`); a test doubles the traits in memory.
//!
//! Blocks come back as decoded transactions (`getblock` verbosity 2, each
//! transaction's `hex`), never as a raw block: a BLAKE2b parent's blocks have
//! 164-byte headers that the parent's serialisation library does not read,
//! and the transaction format is the same on every family.
