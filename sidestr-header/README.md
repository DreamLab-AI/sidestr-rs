# sidestr-header

> Part of [sidestr-rs](https://github.com/DreamLab-AI/sidestr-rs). Rust port of Melvin Carvalho's sidestr sidechains, AGPL-3.0-only: the economic engine for did:nostr agents. A did:nostr key is a sidechain wallet.

Block headers for [sidestr](https://github.com/sidestr/spec) sidechains, in
both families the parent table allows: the stock 80-byte SHA-256d header
(beside `btc` / `tbtc4`) and Bitcoin Knots' 164-byte v2 header with the
tagged-hash-plus-BLAKE2b proof of work (beside `xbt` / `txbt4`). Compact
targets, the `powLimit` check siding applies, the BIP-325 block data over
each family's serialisation, the version-bit-31 rule, and the fork
activation constants of SPEC 3.2.

`#![no_std]`, no allocator, every primitive from RustCrypto (`sha2`,
`blake2`), no `bitcoin` crate dependency — with `default-features = false`.
The default `core` feature adds `sidestr_core::HeaderFamily` for both header
types, so a chain beside `xbt` / `txbt4` validates end to end:

```rust,ignore
use sidestr_core::chain::ChainOf;
use sidestr_header::Blake2bV2;

let chain = ChainOf::<Blake2bV2>::open(doc, "state", None)?; // replays a mirror's blocks.dat
println!("{} at {}", chain.state().genesis_hash(), chain.state().height());
```

```rust
use sidestr_header::{HeaderFamily, Target};

let bytes = hex::decode(
    "0000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003a87d59ecf60ab58ee75948cc39d1bb44ac4285747e64b5a1e7a960d37764cb40e67b26affff7f2002000000",
).unwrap();
let header = HeaderFamily::Stock.decode(&bytes).unwrap();
assert_eq!(header.hash().to_string(),
           "4db37517728bd509c0cb96ee5a2e3e2a77f9e965a092e9f67948b413d453dbc0");
let pow_limit = Target::from_hex("7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff").unwrap();
assert!(header.check_pow(&pow_limit).is_ok());
```

## Why two families

SPEC 3: "everything the overlay does not set is inherited from the parent:
header format and proof-of-work hash … Nothing in the document names a
header format or a hash; the parent decides both." So a chain's header is
the parent's header, and the parent table (SPEC 3.2) has two of them.

## Status

0.3.0 — both families decode, encode, hash and check proof of work against
the reference to the byte; the BIP-325 block data matches siding's
`blockData` on the live `sidestr:dreamlab` block 0. With `core`, the
`Blake2bV2` family runs `sidestr-core`'s rules, state and chain: Melvin
Carvalho's live `sidestr:txbt4-siding` chain (229 blocks, fetched 2026-09-22,
carried under `tests/fixtures`) replays from its genesis to its tip with
every rule on — the Knots overlay's header-height, reserved-flags and
transaction-count rules, and Knots' unified sighash on each of its 16 spends;
`SIDESTR_LIVE=1 cargo test -- --ignored` replays the mirror and `melchain` as
they are now. The crate's own `family::Stock` seals the trial genesis to the
same bytes `sidestr_core::Stock` does. A typed v2 genesis is judged under the
Knots overlay's rules before its hash is compared to the document, a stock
header with bit 31 set is refused on every path (decode, typed rule, replay),
and a mirror's record framing is held to its index — the counter-examples of
the independent 0.2 audit, pinned in `tests/audit_regressions.rs`.

## Attribution

This crate is a port, under the same licence, of:

- [bitcoin-desktop/schema](https://github.com/bitcoin-desktop/schema)
  (AGPL-3.0), commit `b8cbf6337c7450fe14ddc5bce00c7280059aab5d`:
  `codec/pow/knots-header-v2.js` (the v2 proof-of-work pipeline),
  `codec/pow/blake2b.js` and `codec/hash.js` (replaced by RustCrypto),
  `codec/codec.js` (`expandCompact`, the header codec), `codec/headers.js`
  (`compactFromTarget`), `codec/overlays/knots-blake2b.js` (the overlay's
  header and block checks), `schema/overlays/knots-blake2b.jsonld` (the v2
  layout and its field comments, adapted in the rustdoc), and the test
  vectors under `test/vectors/knots/` — Bitcoin Knots' own
  `block_header_v2.json` and real fork headers captured from a Knots 29.4.1
  node on 2026-09-05.
- [sidestr/spec](https://github.com/sidestr/spec) (AGPL-3.0), Melvin
  Carvalho, commit `2de40bdac4cba01be0864156a553d8287c22e279`:
  `siding/lib/block.mjs` (`buildBlock`'s header shape per family,
  `blockData`), `siding/lib/parents.mjs` (the family per parent),
  `siding/lib/chain.mjs` (`bits = compactFromTarget(powLimit)`),
  `siding/lib/overlay.mjs` (`blake2bHeight: 0`, so the overlay's rules and
  the unified sighash apply from the genesis), and `SPEC.md` §3, §3.2, §4.
- [bitcoin-blake/blaketestnode](https://github.com/bitcoin-blake/blaketestnode)
  (AGPL-3.0) is the kernel's reference for the fork chains; nothing was
  ported from it directly.

What changed in the port: the two hand-written hash functions are replaced
by `sha2` and `blake2`; the header is a typed struct per family rather than
a schema-driven object; compact targets that Bitcoin Core rejects (negative,
overflow) are rejected here where the JS kernel is lenient — unreachable on
a valid sidestr chain, where `bits` is pinned to `powLimit`; the genesis is
judged under the family's rules rather than trusted by hash, and `blocks.dat`
record framing is checked against `blocks.json` on replay.
