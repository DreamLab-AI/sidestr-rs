//! `sidestr-wallet` — a wallet for sidestr sidechains, in Rust: the coin
//! set for a script, the reference coin selection, taproot key-path spends
//! and peg-out burns signed behind a signer port, the parent-side peg-in
//! transaction shape, and delivery as a `POST /tx` body or a kind-23500
//! event.
//!
//! A wallet needs a chain id and a relay, and nothing of the producer's
//! (SPEC 11). It learns the chain from a mirror's `chain.json`, held to the
//! signer's announced tip; asks a producer `/coins/<script hex>` for what
//! its script owns, or folds the block file itself with
//! [`sidestr_core::State`] and gets the same list; builds a transaction
//! Bitcoin's rules accept, with the fee at the document's `minFeeRate`; and
//! hands it over as `POST /tx` or as an event on a relay whose key is
//! anyone's, because the transaction authorises itself. A producer includes
//! what validates. A wallet with nothing publishes a kind-23501 request and
//! a faucet may answer it.
//!
//! This crate is a port of **siding**, the reference implementation by
//! Melvin Carvalho (<https://github.com/sidestr/spec>, AGPL-3.0), ported from
//! commit `2de40bdac4cba01be0864156a553d8287c22e279` and brought to SPEC 0.0.3
//! at `722ad42d3271efccfdfaf57c3c6943f58fc168f8` (`lib/txsign.mjs`) — `siding/lib/spend.mjs`,
//! `lib/address.mjs`, the construction halves of `lib/parent.mjs` and
//! `lib/checkpoint.mjs`, and the `send` and `faucet` commands of
//! `bin/siding.mjs` — and carries the same licence, AGPL-3.0-only. `SPEC.md`
//! in that repository is the design; section numbers below are its. Where a
//! function ports a siding function its documentation names it. Consensus
//! types, the markers, addresses and the document come from
//! [`sidestr_core`] and are not duplicated here.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! | module | what | SPEC | ported from |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`coins`] | the coin set for a script: `/coins` JSON or a state fold; maturity | 11 | `siding/lib/chain.mjs coins`, `spend.mjs` |
//! | [`select`] | largest-first selection to the amount plus a fee bound | 11 | `spend.mjs buildSpend` |
//! | [`spend`] | a key-path spend to an address or script, fee at `minFeeRate`, signed, as hex | 11 | `spend.mjs buildSpend`, `resolveTo`; `siding send` |
//! | [`burn`] | a peg-out: `OP_RETURN pegout:<parent script hex>`, at least `pegoutMin` | 7 | `spend.mjs` (`--pegout`) |
//! | [`pegin`] | the parent side: peg output + `pegin:<chain id>:<script>` marker; the peg-out payment and checkpoint shapes; scanning | 6, 7, 11 | `parent.mjs`, `checkpoint.mjs` |
//! | [`deliver`] | `POST /tx`, `/coins`, `/tip`, `/chain.json` as data; kind 23500 / 23501 templates; HTTP behind feature `client` | 11 | `spend.mjs deliver`, `bin/siding.mjs` routes |
//! | [`key`] | the [`SpendSigner`] port, a plain key, pubkey → `5120` script → bech32m, ADR-2101 spend-key derivation | 3 | `sign.mjs`, `address.mjs` |
//! | [`policy`] | the [`SpendPolicy`] hook every builder consults; [`Permissive`] | — | (ADR-2100) |
//!
//! # A payment, end to end
//!
//! Against a chain held in memory — the same calls work against a

//!
//! # Conventions that matter
//!
//! - **Keys stay behind [`SpendSigner`].** A builder computes the key-path
//!   sighash the chain's family requires (BIP 341 beside stock Bitcoin,
//!   Knots' unified beside BLAKE2b) and asks the port to sign it; it never
//!   holds a secret.
//!   [`PlainKey`] is the in-memory implementation; a signer that holds a
//!   derived role key and permits named operations only (ADR-2101) fits the
//!   same trait. [`key::derive_spend_key`] is the derivation; the identity
//!   key never spends.
//! - **The wallet builds and signs; it does not decide.** Every builder
//!   consults a [`SpendPolicy`] with the chain, kind, script, amount, fee
//!   and input count before signing. [`Permissive`] says yes; the authority
//!   gate (ADR-2100) is the caller's implementation.
//! - **The fee is `minFeeRate × vsize`, exactly**, sized with the 65-byte
//!   witness the signer will produce, unless the caller fixes one — and a
//!   fixed fee under the rate is refused here rather than by the producer.
//! - **No I/O by default.** `deliver` returns URLs, bodies and event
//!   templates; feature `client` adds the HTTP calls over `ureq`. Nothing
//!   here publishes to a relay: the event's signature is `sidestr-nostr`'s.
//! - **Amounts are sats**, `u64`; txids in markers are display-order hex, as
//!   the markers carry them; structural txids are [`bitcoin::Txid`].
//!
//! # Where this port departs from siding
//!
//! - **The signature carries its hash type explicitly.** As `txsign.mjs`
//!   does since 0.0.3: `0x01` beside stock Bitcoin, `0x21` beside a BLAKE2b
//!   parent, so every witness is 65 bytes and the fee is sized for that.
//!   The message is the reference's (`tests/oracle.rs` checks each engine
//!   verifies the other's signature); the signature itself differs, since
//!   [`PlainKey`] signs with zero auxiliary randomness and siding with
//!   fresh randomness, so byte equality of whole transactions is not a goal.
//! - **Dust is refused.** siding will pay 1 sat to a taproot script and
//!   return 1 sat of change; this crate refuses an amount under the script's
//!   dust threshold ([`spend::dust_threshold`], 330 sats for taproot) and
//!   leaves change under it to the fee instead of minting an unspendable
//!   coin. A burn's `OP_RETURN` has no dust floor; `pegoutMin` governs it.
//! - **A fixed fee is checked against `minFeeRate`** before signing;
//!   siding lets the producer refuse it.
//! - **Zero BIP 340 auxiliary randomness** in [`PlainKey`], as `sidestr-core`
//!   seals blocks: a spend is a pure function of its inputs and the key.
//! - **The EVM deposit branch is not carried** (`--evm`; ADR-2096 excludes
//!   the `evm` rule), nor are assets (SPEC 12, reserved).
