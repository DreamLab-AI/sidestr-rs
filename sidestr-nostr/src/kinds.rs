//! `docs/PROTOCOL-registry.md`, ADR-2098 D2, ADR-2105).
//!
//! The 2xxxx and 3xxxx numbers are the sidestr spec's, which says its field
//! names, kinds and document shapes are provisional: they are recorded as
//! **externally owned**, and an upstream change to any of them is ADR-2098's
//! review trigger. 38420–38425 are agentbox's, from its 38400–38499 band.
//!
//! Three NIP-01 classes matter here. **Ephemeral** (2xxxx) events are not
//! stored by a relay, so a transaction or a round message that nobody was
//! listening for is gone — durability is the publisher's problem, never the
//! relay's (ADR-2098 amendment: "relay drop is a normal condition").
//! **Addressable** (3xxxx) events are replaced per `(kind, pubkey, d)`, so a
//! tip announcement overwrites the last one and a rule document is one row
//! per activation height. **Regular** events accrete, which is what an
//! evidence trail needs, so the five settlement events are regular.
//!
//! ```
